# Vanilla JavaScript Notes App

## App Info:

This single-page frontend-only Notes App displays a text box where a user can add text and submit a note. The notes first 20 characters is then listed below the textbox as a link, which if clicked will take the user to a hash url that displays the full content of that note. They can add as many notes as they like, with each new note added to the bottom of the note list. If the user creates a note with emoji shortcodes, e.g. :fire:, this text is sent to an [external API](https://makers-emojify.herokuapp.com/) that converts shortcodes into emojis like ðŸ”¥. 

If the user were to refresh the page, their notes will disappear. 

## Notes App User Stories

We were given the user stories below to guide us:

## Technologies:

This app was written in vanilla JS, with Jasmine as the testing framework. 

## Structure

src/ contains all the domain logic. interface.js contains interactions with the user.

## Running this App:

 Option1: open index.html
 Option2: run npm install in the command line which will install http-server

## Testing

open SpecRunner.html. 10 unit tests should be passing. 

Note on tests: I used Jasmine for unit tests. Mocking has not been implemented fully and neither note-controller not interface.js code is tested. If I had mocked all dependencies, I'd create a feature test where the models interact. 
I would maybe use Cypress for user interaction testing/feature testing to cover code in note-controller and interface.js.
